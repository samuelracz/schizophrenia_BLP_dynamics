# Supplementary code for "Diminished Variability of Alpha and Beta Band-limited Power as a Neural Signature in Schizophrenia" by Racz et al. (2025).

This folder contains the complete analysis pipeline for the aformentioned project. The scripts reproduce the main analysis outcomes and figures published in the manuscript. Pipeline is as follows:

- Run analysis scripts first (<script_01_analyze_BLP_ec.m, script_01_analyze_BLP_eo.m, script_01_analyze_BLP_ec_surrogate.m, script_01_analyze_BLP_eo_surrogate.m>)

- 

Note that the code loads the pre-processed EEG data from Matlab workspaces (in data_ec_mara_avg_256Hz_mat/); however, pre-processed EEG is also provided in .edf format (in data_ec_mara_avg_256Hz/).
